# Binary-Search-Tree

## Overview

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. The BST is built from an array of unique numbers and provides various operations such as insertion, deletion, search, traversal, and balancing.

## Features
- Node Class: Represents individual nodes of the tree.
- BST Class: Implements the binary search tree with various functionalities:
-- Build Tree: Constructs a balanced BST from an array.
-- Insert & Delete: Add or remove nodes from the BST.
-- Search: Find a node with a given value.
-- Traversals: Supports in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversal.
-- Tree Properties: Calculate height, depth, and check if the tree is balanced.
-- Rebalance: Convert an unbalanced BST into a balanced one.
-- Visual Representation: Pretty-print the tree structure.
